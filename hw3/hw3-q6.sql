List all cities that cannot be reached from Seattle through a direct flight
and cannot be reached from Seattle with one stop (i.e., with any two flights that go through an intermediate city).
Assume all cities to be the collection of both origin_city and dest_city.
Warning: this query might take a while to execute.
We will learn about how to speed this up in lecture.
Name the output column city. Order the output ascending by city.
